This project was created as an initiative by Penguin Academy to build technology to smoothen the peak impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Paraguayan Health System.

This project is an auto reporting system, allowing anyone to access it and report their symptoms and gat a quick feedback what steps to take next as well as allowing to generate data on the situation.

## Demo and Contributing
